## estimated practical time
Over the course of this topic, my accuracy in calculating the time needed for practical tasks has increased. In the beginning, I frequently discovered that I underestimated the amount of time required for specific jobs, resulting in last-minute rushes. With each task and project, though, I improved my ability to organize my work and take unforeseen difficulties into account. My estimates improved as a result, and I gained a better understanding of time management. During group discussions and retrospectives, peer feedback was really helpful in helping me improve my estimate abilities.
